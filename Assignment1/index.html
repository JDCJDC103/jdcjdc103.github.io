      Hello, this is assignment 1. I will be talking about trees. For the first image I will probably use an image of a tree. The bulleted list is also about trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Books are becoming used less as online books are more popular. This can reduce the amount of trees needed to be cut down for books. The second image will be a book. I need to read more books.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Trees must die to make paper</li>
      <li>We need trees to breathe</li>
      <li>Trees like sunlight</li>
    </ul>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <caption>Things Trees Like and Dislike</caption>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Like</th>
        <th>Dislike</th>
        <th>Neutral</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sunlight</td>
        <td>Chainsaws</td>
        <td>Birds</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
